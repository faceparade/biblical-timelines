Here are the next steps that make sense now, in increasing complexity:

Add Adamic anchor events
(Adam created, Flood, Abraham born, Exodus) as point items

Add Genesis 10 nations
as long-range spans (post-Flood dispersion)

Add JW prophetic overlays
(Gentile Times, 607–1914, etc.) as ranges in their own group

Add demographic envelope
as translucent ranges (non-doctrinal layer)

Lock a CSV schema
so Excel / Sheets can’t sabotage delimiters again
